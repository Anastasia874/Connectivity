# Connectivity
EEG-based analysis of brain connectivity.

## Tools
* Inverse solution was obtain with Brainstorm (http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm): Tadel F, Baillet S, Mosher JC, Pantazis D, Leahy RM (2011) Brainstorm: A User-Friendly Application for MEG/EEG Analysis
* For connectivity analysis FieldTrip toolbox (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/start) is used: Robert Oostenveld, Pascal Fries, Eric Maris, and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, “FieldTrip: Open Source Software for Advanced Analysis of MEG, EEG, and Invasive Electrophysiological Data,” Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, vol. 2011, Article ID 156869, 9 pages, 2011. doi:10.1155/2011/156869
* Time-domain Granger causaluty analysis is based on MVGC toolbox (http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~lionelb/MVGC/html/mvgchelp.html): L. Barnett and A. K. Seth, The MVGC Multivariate Granger Causality Toolbox: A New Approach to Granger-causal Inference, J. Neurosci. Methods 223, 2014.
* Results were visualized with the BrainNet Viewer (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/): Xia M, Wang J, He Y (2013) BrainNet Viewer: A Network Visualization Tool for Human Brain Connectomics. PLoS ONE 8: e68910.
